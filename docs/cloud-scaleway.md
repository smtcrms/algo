### Configuration file

Algo requires an API key from your Scaleway account to create a server.
The API key is generated by going to your Scaleway credentials at [https://console.scaleway.com/account/credentials](https://console.scaleway.com/account/credentials), and then selecting "Generate new token" on the right side of the box labeled "API Tokens".

Enter this token when Algo prompts you for the `auth token`.
This information will be pass as the `algo_scaleway_token` variable when asked for in the Algo prompt.

Your organization ID is also on this page: https://console.scaleway.com/account/credentials
